  The application fetches earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed and plots the earthquakes on an interactive map. Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker, and the size and color of the marker indicate the magnitude and depth of the earthquake. Popups provide additional information when a marker is clicked.
